<h1>Baseline model</h1>
<h6 class="text-white"> The second ingredient of agile model development is the baseline model. This is the most basic, almost stupid model that can be applied to solve the machine learning problem at hand. Such a model can then serve as the baseline for evaluating more sophisticated models, and provide a clear basis for comparison.

Baseline model should be a simple algorithm, the simplest one that can be applied to the task. For example, the nearest neighbour algorithm can be applied to both classification and regression tasks without much effort, yielding a reasonable performance out-of-the-box. Or it may not even involve any machine learning at all: a random sample can provide a good sanity check. Or it may involve a more complex example: like when predicting events with a weekly period, the baseline may be to use "what happened at the same time last week" as a prediction. Whatever model you choose, it should be easy to fit without creating additional complexity.

Overall, a good baseline model provides:

Better understanding of the nature of the task.
Baseline performance.
A way to run the evaluation process end-to-end.
Once we run the baseline model through the evaluation platform, we get a single number that quantifies the performance we can achieve with the simplest approach. It may be good enough already - or it can serve as something to beat.

<p class="text-white mt-5">The evaluation platform and the baseline model form the basis of the agile model development in data science, allowing fast iteration and progress. The baseline model gives us an initial threshold to improve upon. The evaluation platform provides a clear performance measure. Now we are ready to create more interesting machine learning models while explicitly tracking their performance.</p>

<p class="text-white">    Because agile is such an overloaded word in software development, we should specify what we mean by agile in this context. Here, agile represents an iterative process of creating increasingly sophisticated machine learning models with fast feedback provided by the evaluation platform. Fitting machine learning models is often a playful curiosity-driven activity - the evaluation platform with the baseline enables productive experimentation with clear performance checks.</p>
